This project focuses on analysis of course trend based on the grades obtained by the student in each course. The system takes the grading policy, the student marks as the input and generates various graphs for analysis of the student grades. The CTA (Course Trend Analyzer) will be used by the professors to analyze the performance of the class. The analysis will be done for the following purposes: range of grades by the class in a particular test (grade range vs.  number of students), performance of an individual student (the test type (quiz or assignment or exam) vs. marks obtained by each student), performance of the whole class in each test (the test type (quiz or assignment or exam) vs. marks obtained by all the students).
